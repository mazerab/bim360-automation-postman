# Getting Postman to service your BIM needs 

This project aims at documenting ways to automate tasks in BIM360 Docs. 
The automation is powered by combining the Forge BIM360 and Data Management APIs. 

It focuses on the process of writing, running, and automating API tests with Postman.

# Getting Started
TODO: Guide users through getting your code up and running on their own system. In this section you can talk about:

# Build and Test
TODO: Describe and show how to build your code and run the tests. 

# Contribute
