## Description

This project aims at documenting ways to automate tasks in BIM360 Docs. 
The automation is powered by combining the Forge [BIM360](https://forge.autodesk.com/en/docs/bim360/v1/reference/http/) and [Data Management](https://forge.autodesk.com/en/docs/data/v2/reference/http/) APIs. 

It focuses on the process of writing, documenting, running, and automating API tests with [Postman](https://www.postman.com/).
